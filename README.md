# AboutThis is a github for that will download the inputted website urls and convert them into a wordcloud image. # Installation and UsageIn order to install this app from scratch, we need to start with:1. `git clone https://github.com/ramayyala/trgn_wordcloud` 2. Install the dependencies which is documented in the [dependencies](https://github.com/ramayyala/trgn_wordcloud#dependencies) section3. In order to run the script **generate_wordcloud_from_file.sh**, you need to add your list of url's to a text file called **my_webpages.txt** which is included in the github. 3. Then simply run the script by running the command `./generate_wordcloud_from_file.sh`# Dependencies## 1. **Wordcloud Image**In order to install wordcloud image into your server, you need to run the following commands:<br />`pip install wordcloud`<br />`cd ~/bin`<br />`git clone https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud.git`<br />`cd word_cloud`<br />Now if you **do not** have superuser permissions, you will likely encounter an error regarding not having access to install wordcloud. In order to bypass this, run this command:<br />`python -m pip install --user wordcloud`<br />This will install wordcloud to your user rather than to the entire system which you need superuser permissions for.  ## 2. **Web Server**In order for the wordcloud to be displayed on your server, you need to set up the server as a webserver. To make sure your server is up and running, follow these steps:<br />    1. Create a folder called **public_html** in your home directory like so:<br />       `mkdir ~/public_html`<br />    2. Within the **public_html**, create a file called index.html, so we can run a unit test to make sure your server is working. The index.html file just needs to contain some basic html to just to see if the server is displaying your file correctly.<br />     3. Once you run **generate_wordcloud_from_file.sh**, a png called **wordcloud.png** should be created in the **~/public_html** directory. In order to get this image to be displayed on the webserver, you need to add the image to your index file using this line:<br />        `<img src="myimage.png"></img>`<br />    4. Your image should be displayed on the web server once this is added and look something like this.        ![wordcloud example](https://github.com/ramayyala/trgn_wordcloud/blob/main/wordcloud_example.png) # Contact Please do not hesistate to contact us (rayyala@usc.edu) if you encounter any problems, or have any comments and suggestions regarding this project.
